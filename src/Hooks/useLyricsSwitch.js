            <br />For the opposition I yearn for the same thing
            <br />But instead there's bloodshed and buckets of death
            <br />There's lots of last breaths and a whole lot of realized threats
            <br />When the reaper comes down swinging right and left
            <br />Leaders going 'round pretending to be deaf
            <br />And I'm still not sure how I can see this pain
            <br />And try to love you without feeling like I'm inhumane
            <br />I've got so much I don't know how I'm supposed to be okay
            <br />So I abstain from this disdain and try to just entertain
