                <br />I won't forget tending you
                <br />Not that I can prove
                <br />What I say is true
                <br />Constantly I am trying to
                <br />Show I can improve
                <br />
                <br />I know you're coming some day
                <br />I will try not to complain
                <br />I've been so long without hope
                <br />I will not be alone
                <br />
                <br />Honest tongue
                <br />Oh, this world is rough
                <br />But don't you know, don't you know
                <br />Don't you wait for everything?
                <br />All this life is gone
                <br />And I will say today
                <br />All that you play is gray
                <br />And I will pray tonight: may you glow
                <br />After all of this time
                <br />It's gonna be right
                <br />After all of this time, this time
                <br />
                <br />I will not be afraid dear
                <br />Although you can come to me
                <br />I'm not allowed to show you
                <br />How I really feel
                <br />
                <br />Ooh
                <br />Ooh-hooh
                <br />Ooh-hooh
