            <br />I'm absconding
            <br />It's beyond me
            <br />It's so daunting
            <br />It's so awing how the law is violated
            <br />And for Gaza I'm wishing for free-living
            <br />Fewer missing
            <br />Less attrition
            <br />Abolition of munitions
            <br />Politicians with cognition
            <br />For the opposition I yearn for the same thing
            <br />But instead there's bloodshed and buckets of death
            <br />There's lots of last breaths and a whole lot of realized threats
            <br />When the reaper comes down swinging right and left
            <br />Leaders going 'round pretending to be deaf
            <br />And I'm still not sure how I can see this pain
            <br />And try to love you without feeling like I'm inhumane
            <br />I've got so much I don't know how I'm supposed to be okay
            <br />So I abstain from this disdain and try to just entertain
            <br />Maybe ascertain the truth of this refrain
            <br />
            <br />If you ever knew (It's nice to be with you)
            <br />How much I feel I fall short of (Every day I wake up)
            <br />I swear I'll come through (With things to look forward to)
            <br />I'll make you feel like you're enough (I really feel your love)
            <br />If I could foresee (It's never been so easy for me)
            <br />How you and I'd be (With anybody else that I've seen)
            <br />Always quick to have the first laugh (I'm so thankful every second we have)
            <br />I want this time to always last
            <br />
            <br />Mmm
